                    Users want to find answers to their questions quickly and data shows that people really care about
                    how quickly their pages load. The Search team announced speed would be a ranking signal for desktop
                    searches in 2010 and as of this month (July 2018), page speed will be a ranking factor for mobile
                    searches too.
